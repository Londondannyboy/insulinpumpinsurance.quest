## Common Questions (FAQ)

### Are insulin pumps covered by insurance?
Yes, specialist UK providers offer comprehensive insurance specifically designed for insulin pumps and diabetes technology. Standard home insurance may provide limited coverage, but specialist policies offer broader protection including accidental damage, theft, loss, and worldwide travel coverage.

### How much does insulin pump insurance cost?
Typical costs range from £6.95 to £10 per month (£83.40 to £120 annually) depending on:
- Device value and type
- Coverage amount selected
- Excess amount chosen
- Device age and condition
- Whether pump is NHS-funded or privately purchased

### Do I need insurance if my pump is on the NHS?
NHS provides free replacement for faulty pumps under warranty, but does NOT cover:
- Theft or loss (patient financially responsible)
- Accidental damage (patient may pay for replacement)
- Worldwide travel protection
- Fast replacement (can take weeks vs 24 hours with insurance)

### What devices can I insure?
All major insulin pump brands:
- Medtronic (780G, 670G, 640G)
- Omnipod (DASH, 5)
- Tandem (t:slim X2)
- Ypsomed
- Roche Accu-Chek

CGM systems:
- Dexcom (G6, G7)
- FreeStyle Libre (2, 3)

### How quickly are claims processed?
Specialist diabetes technology insurers typically process claims within 24 hours. Approved claims often result in replacement device shipping within 1-2 business days, with loan equipment available during processing.

### Can I add my pump to home insurance?
Possible but not recommended. Home insurance typically:
- Requires high excess amounts (£100-£500)
- Provides limited coverage outside the home
- Doesn't cover accidental damage comprehensively
- Lacks diabetes technology expertise
- May increase overall home insurance premium significantly

### Is there an age limit for coverage?
Most specialist providers cover pump users of all ages, from children (with parental policy holder) to elderly adults. Some providers offer specialized children's policies with enhanced features for school and activity coverage.

### Does insurance cover worldwide travel?
Yes, most policies include worldwide travel coverage for 90 days per trip. This protects your device against:

- Accidental damage abroad
- Emergency replacement while away from home
